# Cassette


## Objective
To show animated cassette when music is playing with the lowest cpu usage.


## Config

size
position {x, y}
colors {foreground, background, reel}


## Update model

- update systematically
cassette script uses popen to run mpd-album-duration for current status

- update asynchronously
cassette script does sth to know when to update status and updates it


## Reasoning

I'd like to run mpd-album-duration in async mode. And by than I mean that it
will only reload stats file when song or player state changes.  Conky script
then will watch stats file for changes and when it occurs cassette status will
be updated.

Or should I just refresh cassette systematically 'cause it still is fast
enough and not much will change? If so, then how often should cassette be
updated?

Well, if one second is too much, then I guess I should engage the first idea.
Because waiting one second for cassette to stop after pausing song is not sexy.
